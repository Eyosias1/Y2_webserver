# TP Web-Serveur

The back-end of a colored sticker dot management app.

## Java version

We're using Java 11 here, for compatibility reasons. It seems that the sweetspot is between 8 and 11 with the current settings - more research and tuning would be required in order to clear this up.

## Running the app (UNIX system)
`cd starter-master`

`./gradlew run`

then enter `https://localhost:8081/` in a browser .
