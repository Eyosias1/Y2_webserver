# TP Web-Serveur

The back-end of a colored sticker dot management app.

## Java version

We're using Java 11 here, for compatibility reasons. It seems that the sweet spot is between 8 and 11 with the current
settings - more research and tuning would be required in order to clear this up.

## Running the app (on a UNIX system)

`cd starter-master`

`./gradlew run`

Then enter `localhost:8081/` in a browser.

You may have to ignore an SLF4J warning message, so don't worry too much if you see red in your terminal.
